\
Ufo Fighter is an arcade game where the player controls a spaceship to destroy alien ships, protecting his planet. As the player, you have to try to destroy as many enemy ships as possible without getting killed. The further you get, the more points you earn.

You can upgrade your ship before each battle at your local shop. You pick up money during the battle. Be careful! It might cost you your life!

Stay alert, the aliens are coming!

Have a nice game!
